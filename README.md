## Synopsis

Hi, this is MAMA'S TWO-DECK SOLITAIRE.  It is a GAME.  It plays Mama's 
Two-Deck Solitaire.  For Windows only at this time. It was written in C++ 
because I didn't know any better.

## Code Example

No example.

## Motivation

This was my capstone project. It seemed a lot more interesting than Yet One
More pseudo ATM or the other examples we were given.  I got permission to do 
this instead and ... voila!

## Installation

It's an .exe file.  You run it like you run any program in Windows. If you 
need help running programs in Windows, contact Microsoft.  Seriously.

## API Reference

## Tests

## Contributors

Would love to see this become a GUI but have not the clue.
