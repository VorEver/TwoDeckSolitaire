Description
-----------
See Rules.txt for information on the game itself.  This was my capstone project for my Associate's in Applied Science in Computer Programming.  I have a Java Specialization but I took my data structures class in C++ so it seemed a better fit to write this in C++.

I was going to try to learn Qt so I could do actual cards in a GUI but that
didn't pan out like I anticipated so you have what I have here.  

Deadlines. They are heck on project scope.

This was done in Microsoft Visual Studio whatever version I had then in Win7--
I do not know as Cortana and her wicked Windows 10 upgraded me in the dark of
night as I slept.  Due to related circumstances, I ended up starting over 
from s-c-r-a-t-c-h in May, 2016 shortly after I'd turned in the project. I now
dual-boot Win10 and Linux Mint.  I'm typing this in Mint now. 

Ancillary Comments
------------------
Considering that I did this entirely by myself in thirteen weeks (after I had
it approved and stuff--the semester is sixteen weeks, but there was paperwork
involved) while taking other classes, I think I did okay for a first major 
object-oriented project in a relatively new-to-me language.  Also figure some 
weeks wasted on trying to do Qt.

This is also my first GitHub.  So if it's messed up, I apologize in advance.
